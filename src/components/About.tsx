              Hi, I'm Liam Hanson - an 18 year old Illinois based Brand scaler and marketing specialist.

              I help DTC brands scale fast using paid ads through Meta, Instagram and TikTok. When I'm not deep in ads manager, I'm testing creatives with Figma or browsing ad trends.

              My journey started with copywriting and grew through leadership experiences in door-to-door sales and training kids for basketball. After rebuilding my confidence following early trading losses, I discovered my true calling: scaling brands through strategic paid advertising that drives results. Every setback taught me resilience, and every success reinforced my belief in the power of data-driven marketing.
